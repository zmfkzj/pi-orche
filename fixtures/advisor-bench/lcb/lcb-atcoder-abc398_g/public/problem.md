# Not Only Tree Game

You are given a simple undirected graph with N vertices and M edges, with vertices labeled 1 to N and edges labeled 1 to M. The i-th edge connects vertices U_i and V_i. Initially, G does not contain an odd cycle.
Takahashi and Aoki will play a game using this graph G. With Aoki going first, they take turns performing the following operation:

- Choose a pair of integers (i,j) with 1 \leq i < j \leq N that satisfies both of the following conditions, then add an edge connecting vertices i and j to G.
- G does not already have an edge connecting vertices i and j.
- Adding an edge connecting vertices i and j does not create an odd cycle.



A player who cannot perform this operation loses, and the other player wins.
Determine who wins when both players play optimally.

What is an odd cycle?
A sequence of vertices (v_0,v_1,\ldots,v_k) of G is called an odd cycle if and only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:

- k is odd.
- v_0=v_k.
- For every 1\leq i \leq k, there is an edge connecting v_{i-1} and v_{i}.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M
U_1 V_1
U_2 V_2
\vdots
U_M V_M

Output

If Aoki (the first player) wins, print Aoki; otherwise, if Takahashi (the second player) wins, print Takahashi.

Constraints


- 1 \leq N \leq 2\times 10^5
- 0 \leq M \leq 2\times 10^5
- 1 \leq U_i < V_i \leq N
- The given graph does not contain an odd cycle.
- The given graph does not contain multi-edges.
- All input values are integers.

Sample Input 1

4 3

Sample Output 1

Aoki

If Aoki (the first player) adds the edge (1,4), Takahashi (the second player) cannot move. Thus, Aoki wins.

Sample Input 2

3 4

Sample Output 2

Takahashi

No matter how Aoki plays, Takahashi wins.
